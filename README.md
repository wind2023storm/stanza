This project is meant to be a standalone Python version of CoreNLP. Right now we aim to replicate the functionality of the main components of CoreNLP.
For now, this includes the following parts of the processing pipeline:
  * tokenize
  * cleanxml
  * ssplit
  * truecase
  * pos
  * lemma
  * ner, regexner
  * sutime
  * tokensregex
  * parse, depparse
  * sentiment
  * entitymentions, mention, coref
  * openie
  * kbp
  * entitylink
